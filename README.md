# Workforce Planning Dashboard (Healthcare)

## Overview
This project demonstrates my approach to workforce planning and scenario analysis in a healthcare context. Due to data confidentiality requirements, underlying datasets and dashboards are not publicly shared.

## Business Problem
Leadership needed visibility into workforce costs and staffing scenarios under varying funding assumptions to support planning and budgeting decisions.

## Approach
- Designed a Power BI data model integrating staffing levels, FTE assumptions, salary bands, and funding scenarios
- Built scenario-based calculations to compare workforce costs across multiple planning options
- Developed interactive visuals to support leadership review and decision-making

## Key Insights
- Identified cost drivers across roles and staffing levels
- Highlighted trade-offs between staffing capacity and budget constraints
- Enabled rapid comparison of alternative workforce scenarios

## Outcome
The dashboard supported leadership discussions around staffing strategy, budget planning, and funding alignment.

## Notes on Data
All data used in this project was confidential and is not shared publicly. This repository focuses on analytical structure, logic, and decision-support approach rather than specific values.
